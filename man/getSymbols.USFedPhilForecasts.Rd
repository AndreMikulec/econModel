getSymbols.USFedPhilForecasts(
  Symbols,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Symbols}{A character vector.  Required. Specifies the names of each symbol to be loaded
To get all of the data use: "USFedPhilForecastsData".  Possible individual
Symbols are listed in the Forecasters documentation: (1) Historical Data Files for the Survey
of Professional Forecasters (2) Documentation: PDF Provides information on
all variables, transformations, and files in the survey.
E.g. "UNEMP". Symbols will be returned as (xts) data.}

\item{env}{Environment. Default is the global environment. Where to create objects.}

\item{Fun}{Function.  Default is mean. This is the aggregating function.  NA data cells are automatically removed from the data before the (remaining) data is sent to the aggregating function.}

\item{...}{Dots passed to Fun.}

\item{return.class.}{String. Desired class of returned object.  Default is "xts".
The value can be "zoo", "data.frame", or "xts".}
}
\value{
A call to getSymbols.USFedPhilForecasts will load into the specified
environment one object for each \code{Symbol} specified,
with class defined by \code{return.class}.

\description{
About the data, file Structure: Column Header Nomenclature and Forecast Horizons: ("1") through ("6") are quarterly forecasts and ("A") and ("B") annual forecasts.

The number ("1") represents the forecast of the quarter prior to the quarter in
which the survey is conducted. The forecasters know the values of the variables for this
quarter at the time they submit their projections in comparison to official revisions(corrections) of the official data.
The forecasters are permitted to forecast a revision.

The number ("2") represents the forecast for the current quarter, defined as
the quarter in which the survey is conducted. The numbers ("3") through ("6")
represent the forecasts for the four quarters after the current quarter.
The letters ("A") and ("B") represent annual average forecasts
for the current year (the year in which the survey is conducted) and
the following year.

INDUSTRY means: financial service provider ("1"), non-financial service provider ("2"), or do not know the industry ("3").  INDUSTRY is not shown in the output data.

About PR*, probability forecasts, read the documentation. This is "very" complicated.

About the date/time index, deadlines for responses are at late in the second week of the middle month of each quarter.
This report is released to the public in the second week of of the middle month of each quarter.
True deadline and news release dates for surveys prior to 1990:Q2 are not known.

Therefore, for simplicity in this R function, the index date is estimated to be at the mid-point of the quarter.

The 1990Q2 survey was not taken in real time, because the Philadelphia Fed
had not yet taken over the survey. Forecasters were asked to provide dated
forecasts from May 1990.
The 1996Q1 survey was delayed because of the federal government shutdown,
which in turn delayed the release of government statistical data.

The 2013Q4 survey was delayed because of the federal government shutdown,
which in turn delayed the release of government statistical data.
