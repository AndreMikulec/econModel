\usage{
toPeriod(
  x,
  Period = "months",
  k = 1L,
  kOfx = 1L,
  PeriodEnd = NULL,
  FunEach = identity,
  FunAll = NC,
  fillInterior = T,
  fillInteriorBy = "days",
  Calendar = "UnitedStates/GovernmentBond",
  BusDayConv = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{xts object}

\item{Period}{Period to convert to. Default is "months".
See ? seq.POSIXt: "secs", "mins", "hours", "days", "weeks", "months", "quarters" or "years"
This is the aggregation (summary).  ONLY "weeks" IS IMPLEMENTED.  OTHERS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.}

\item{k}{Integer. Default is 1L.  Number of k Periods. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.}

\item{kOfx}{Integer. Default is 1L. This is the SubPeriod of the Period where the last observation of x exists.  If Period = "weeks" and k == 2L, then kOfx has possible values of 1L(week 1) or 2L(week 2). NOT YET IMPLEMENTED}

\item{PeriodEnd}{Integer. Default is NULL meaning use the expected period end.  If Period is "weeks", the default is 7L, and this value can be  (1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, ... 7 - Sunday).  See ? DescTools::Weekday. If Period = "weeks" and k > 1, then PeriodEnd can be greater than 7L.  E.g. if k == 2L and PeriodEnd == 11L, then  PeriodEnd is the 2nd Thursday.}

\item{FunEach}{Function. Has one argument: x; that is the xts object of the period. Default is identity. Function to be applied per period.  The value at the, per period, "last" positions is the "end of period"(EOP).}

\item{FunAll}{Function. Default is econModel::NC. Has two argemetnss: x; that is the xts object of all periods; EOPIndex is the index of EOP index values. This function to be applied across all periods.}

\item{fillInterior}{Logical. Default is TRUE. Created sub-Period data points.  The default is "days". NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.}

\item{fillInteriorBy}{String. If fillInterior is TRUE, then default is "days". Put in sub-Period data. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.}

\item{Calendar}{Default is "UnitedStates/GovernmentBond". Calendar to use.  See ?? RQuantLib::Calendars.  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.}

\item{BusDayConv}{Integer.  Default is 0L.  See \url{https://www.quantlib.org/reference/group__datetime.html} See ? RQuantLib::Enum ? RQuantLib::adjust and parameter bcd(Business Day Convention). 0L means if the Day falls on a Holiday (Holiday includes weekends), then Following: the first business day after the given holiday becomes the (new) adjusted date.}
